# Introduction

From a humble $13.50, to a gargantuan $750, the price of a life saving drug
skyrocketed overnight [1].  Daraprim, as a drug that treats toxoplasmosis,
sparked enormous controversy over the price hike.  People, outraged, argued
there is ethical obligation to lower drug prices.  Companies in return disavowed 
any moral obligation to lower prices, and claim R&D efforts will result in more 
life saving medications [2].

Many of the populous claim that everyone should have access to the medications they need,
but this ideal conflicts with real world considerations.  This is the reason
drug pricing policy is very controversial.  The yen for affordable medication
is stronger than ever before.  The pharmaceutical industry is a complex system
with numerous nuts and bolts.  Attempts at reconciling the wishes of the public
with reality do not offer sustainable solutions.  The product of wishful
thinking, low-cost drug pricing policies cause inefficiencies in drug discovery
and overall patient well-being.  Integral to everything, the nuts and bolts
start to rust, clogging the system.  One's own conception of ethics lack the
sophistication needed to evaluate something so complex.  Elusive to both
public and private sector frameworks, the answer hides in sensible public
policy while keeping the pharmaceutical industry private.

# Background

To adequately analyze drug pricing policy, one must understand how the
pharmaceutical industry operates.  The trek from the supplier to the hands of 
the consumer is a complex multifaceted system. To conceptualize this system, first
one must understand the pharmaceutical supply chain.  The supply chain has six moving
parts.  The manufacturers are responsible for the supply of drugs.  They have
two different product profiles: brand drugs, and generics.  Brand drugs are
patented giving whoever holds the rights to the patent exclusive rights to the
drug.  This gives the manufacturer a monopoly over the drug for a limited
amount of time.  After this time limit has expired the drug becomes a generic.
Generic drugs can be sold by other companies creating competition and lowering
the price of generics.  Companies whose portfolio consists of generic drugs
generally do not invent new drugs.  On the other hand, brand manufacturers
typically spend a portion of their revenue on research and development (R&D).
Investments in R&D will increase long term earnings; this is an important
aspect of drug discovery and the pharma business model.  The manufacturers are 
responsible for the distribution of the drugs to wholesalers, pharmacies,
hospitals, government, and sometimes sell directly to patients [3].  Wholesale
distributors buy drugs from the manufacturers and sell them to pharmacies,
hospitals, and long-term care facilities, among others [3].  The gatekeeper of
medicines, pharmacies are the final stop before pharmaceuticals reach the hands 
of the consumers.  They are responsible for getting drugs into the hands of
patients.  Specialty pharmacies distribute expensive drugs to patients with
chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and other rare
diseases [3].  These pharmaceuticals are administered by injection or intravenously [3].
Long-term care pharmacies provide medical needs to nursing homes [3].  Lastly,
the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) oversee prescription drug benefits [3].
PBMs work with private insurers on deciding which drugs are covered as well as the amounts
that the consumer will pay out of pocket and how much the pharmacy will
receive [3].

Now that the supply chain's blueprint has been laid out, the next concept to
cover is the financial relationships between different in links
the chain.  A product of many intense negotiations, the flow of money is more
complex than the physical distribution of drugs.  The pharmaceutical
manufacturers set the baseline price of the drug.  This price is derived from the demand of
the product, future competition, projected market costs, and the patients'
ability to pay for the drug [3].  Through negotiations, the manufacturer can off
discounted prices based off the percent difference between average price of the drug and the baseline price [3].
This allows end users the ability to purchase the drug for an amount between 5 to 40 percent of the average price [3].
Wholesale distributors purchase drugs from the manufacturer for a discounted
baseline price [3].  They will then sell the drug to pharmacies for the baseline
price, pocketing the difference.  The profits from prescription drugs go from
the pharmacy to the manufacturer.  These profits are the result of negotiations
between the pharmacies, PBMs, and manufacturers.  

# Positions

## Ethical Obligations

Ethical objections to a free-market approach on drug pricing propose that there
is an obligation to provide equal access to everyone regardless of
their status.  In other words, the poor should have the same access to
medication as the wealthy.  Medicine is a commodity 
that has a major effect on one's ability to pursue happiness.  Ethical
questions arise such as---is it morally reprehensible to profit off of human
suffering when there is an immutable demand for the product?  A Kantian 
approach based off John Rawls' definition of justice, claims that people 
"...posses the ability to develop a rational plan to pursue...the good life
along with the ability to respect...self-determination in others" [2].  Because
medicine directly affect's ones right certain liberties, it needs to be
distributed equally.  In a system where there is an unequal distribution of
pharmaceuticals, the disadvantaged are in a worse position than those with merit.
Even if there is the possibility the less fortunate are neglected due to pricing
policy, denying them a life saving opportunity would conflict with this
Rawlsian standpoint.  This argument aligns with the conclusion that
pharmaceutical companies are required to bear this ethical burden.

## Pro-Privatization Argument

Critics of government regulated health policy align with the libertarian
viewpoint that government involvement should be minimal and individuals should
be responsible for their own pursuit for vocational or personal success. A
monopsony, Canada's health care system provides a good case study of the
effects of a single-payer system.  Canada's system "...has grown too comprehensive and too costly to be funded by the public
purse..." [5]. Without enough pecuniary support critical programs have begun to wilt. The government has had
to ration medical services weakening programs that need to meet a large and
growing demand [5].  Witnessing the effects of restructuring the
healthcare system, medical staff and the public "...show a high degree of
concern about lack of accessibility and deterioration of quality of care, with
65% of members of the public responding to one poll...[indicated] concerns
about these issues..." [5].  Even though medicine and medical services
are affordable to everyone, rationing has created a jaded system that threatens the urgent need for an accessible
medical attention as well as the quality of care provided.  Spawning from this
dissatisfaction, contrarians of universal healthcare claim that a public system
is too demanding to meet the demand for medical care.

# Evaluation

Ethical arguments for inventing a drug pricing scheme fall far from
short of adequately addressing the problem at hand because they fail to account
for real world consequences.  In a capitalist society, claiming the pharmaceutical
industry is exempt from the laws of capitalism is preposterous, but not
entirely unfounded.  Obviously sympathy needs to be had for the patients and 
families of patients that need medicine to survive.  Reconciling this sentiment with the
limitations reality imposes is difficult.  Pharmaceutical companies, if they
are smart, put a certain amount of their revenue into R&D which improves long
term earnings as well as pushes medical innovation forward.  If pharmaceuticals
were sold for cheap, there would be less money going into research.
Even if everyone had equal access to medicine, the rate of drug development
would decrease significantly.  Financing is an important part of the
pharmaceutical industry that low prices and government funding won't be enough
to support pharmaceutical research.

First and foremost, companies will not research drugs that without a financial
incentive. At the mercy of market forces, drug companies' product portfolios are vulnerable to risk [3].
In a precarious climate, "...individual companies are too small to pool internally the combination of
(highly skewed) market and regulatory risks," [3] which would make low prices
unsustainable.  Drugs which have a small patient population do not provide enough
profits to support all financial expenses and R&D programs.  These drugs, often
referred to as orphan drugs, need to have a high price per patient to support
its production.  Without enough cash to invent drugs for rare diseases, people
suffering from these ailments will not be able to survive.  In the USA alone, 39
percent of drugs in development were abandoned [4].  Without the life-giving
power of medicine, victims of rare diseases
will wither and die without enough financial motive for manufacturers.  Diseases in third world
countries will continue to ravage civilization without medication.  Consequences from the butterfly effect
would not stop there.  Foreign exports make up a portion of drug sales in the USA.  With rate of drugs invented decreasing, foreign countries who purchase drugs from the USA 
would be left out to dry, resulting with potentially complex economic impacts.  
From a Utilitarian standpoint, higher drugs prices, will lead to more R&D which
will improve the field of medicine and provide society with more treatments for
diseases.  Profit loss due equal distribution of medicine, "fair
prices", or overwhelming government regulation will hinder medical progress and
possibly result in fewer new medicines developed.


A solution to underfunding is a non-profit regulated insurance system. In this system,
insurance companies provide risk-adjusted premiums and universal
coverage.  Insurance providers would pool their risk which would create an
affordable option for patients in most income brackets [5].  This 
is not an innovative idea; similar systems have existed across industrialized western
civilizations, including Australia "where more than 1 million people with
annual earnings of less than $23,000 are covered," [5].  The system is
effective because those who are able to consider a private provider, will
decrease waiting lists for those deciding to use the pubic option [5].
Underfunding and cutbacks affect the ability to give patients the quality of
care they need.  Regulation over a private system would be affordable to most
wage-earners, and those who can not afford it have the public option.  Premiums
set by actuarial risk wouldn't allow insurers to select only low risk clients,
without suffering any monetary setbacks besides windfall profits.
A risk pool would allow the insurance companies to cover the price of medicine
without threatening the incentive needed to make innovative medical
discoveries.


# Conclusion

Most arguments lack substance and fail to offer any any practical applications. Crusty criticisms of both private and public based health care are founded in
political biases armed with stories of patients dying because they cannot
afford to get their medication.   A regulated non-profit insurance system
would give people access to medical services without prejudice. The most esteemed value in American society is
the freedom of choice and expression.  This system unifies two polar
opposite standpoints by giving people the choice
to develop and pursue a life plan,
as well as continuation of the flow of medical inventions without hindrance.

# Corrections
(1): 1a and 1b are a bit dramatic/imprecise. word choice.
(2): check pandoc flags for super-script citation numbering.
(3): "as a drug..." -> "a drug...": 
    Unnecessary specification of role with "as". 
(4): "argued there..." -> "argued that there" :
    I dunno about this, but the "that" seems safer.
(5): "claim" -> "claimed":
    Maintain past-tense? You used "disavowed", so "claimed" seems more
    appropriate, otherwise change "disavowed" to "disavow".
(6): "populous" -> "populace"
(7):  clarify
    Who is "everyone" -- citizens? humans?  What justifies "should"? On what
    grounds ought we provide care? (This "should" comment may be premature.)
(8): word choice
    What is "need"?
(9):
    Such as?
(10): word choice
    What a good word! There may be less obtuse synonyms however, especially
    since you speak of prices in the surrounding sentences; I thought you
    referred to the currency -- admittedly I didn't know the word "yen".
(11): weak, or imprecise metaphor?
    I'm not sure how well this works. Metaphors are tricky business; use at
    your own risk.
(12):  vague
    Whose morality is lacking here and why does their deficiency matter? It
    seems a bit of a jump to suddenly concern the reader with the capacity of
    the average citizen's moral framework to meaningfully analyze the
    pharmaceutical industry. That of a politician or a drug rep/CEO would seem
    more natural, otherwise some transition, or explanation/justification of
    relevence seems appropriate.
(13): "lack" -> "lacks"
    Singular conjugation as determined by use of the subject "conception".
(14): more vagueness
    The answer to what specific couching/framing of the issue? You may want to
    summarize the issue in a kind of distilled problem statement after
    introducing the backgound info, so that there is a specific question to
    which the "answer" replies.
(15): word choice
    Can a drug "trek"? It seems an anthropomorphization only justifiable if the
    responsible verb lends a particularly expressive analogy.
(16): "complex multi..." -> "complex, multi..." ? idk for sure.   
(17): "expired the..." -> "expired, the..." 
(18): comma again
(19): informality
    Is "pharma" an appropriate term in a formal essay?
(20): uniform plurality in list
    Would "governments" work, or are the pharma companies subject to discussion
    selling exclusively to the U.S. gov't? In any case, elements in a list
    should have the same tense, plurality, etc.
(21): "and sometimes sell directly to patients" -> "and, sometimes, to patients" 
    Same reason as (20).
(22): Unnecessarily specific article. Omit "the".
(23): 
    This and the previous sentence are a bit redundant. They could be
    combined.
    Do pharmacies have any other responsibilites? It was slightly unclear if
    there duties included, or were limited to, those stated.
(24): plurality agreement?
    Can 24a, the singular "concept" represent "relationships"? Perhaps you mean
    someting more in the vein of "the next concepts covered decribe financial
    relationships"?
(25): see (22)
(26): like (20), "derived from the demand of.." -> "derived from demand for.."
"the patients' ability..." -> "patient buying/purchasing power"
(27): see (22).
(28): "off" -> "offer"
(29): Generally, use "based off of" or "based on". 
    In this case, don't use "off" as you use "offer" only a few words prior and
    the phonetic similarity is off-putting.
(30): "..een average.." -> "..een the average.."
(31): semantic ambiguity
    This one, I think, is on me; I don't understand how an average price is
    obtained prior to setting discounted prices as the average includes the
    discounted ones, no? Perhaps a bit more clarity is needed, or I'm a
    dumbass; sadly they're not mutually exclusive.
(32): omit "the ability"
(33): Coverage of the role of insurance (companies)
    Perhaps I'm off base here, but I'd like more detail regarding the role of
    insurance companies, or PBMs, as you refer to them, especially as they
    impact the consumer perception of pricing.
(34): "approach on" -> "approach to"
(35): see (7). This is prolly the better place to address the ambiguity.
(36): issue of chronology
    Rawls expanded upon Kant's ideas with his theory of justice, not the
    other way around.
(37): see (29)
(38): "posses" -> "possess" | "posses [sic]"
(39): "affect's" -> "affects"
(40): "ones" -> "one's"
(41): "right certain.." -> "right to certain.."
(42): "need" see (8)
    Also, I presume you are explaining the position of a Rawlsian approach.
    If so clarify. It read as though, _you_ asserted that "need".
(43): "equally" is vague as shit. 
    Perhaps whip out Rawls' Veil of Innocence to provide _some_ metric for
    "equality"?
(44): redundant
    the disadvantaged will of course, almost by definition, hold a "worse
    position"
(45): vague; dependent on implicit definitions of "merit" and such
    naturally the generally disadvantaged are worse off than those with the
    oh-so-broad "merit" of which you speak. What is this "merit"? How is it
    identified and weighed?
(46): unclear
    The possibility of what? A comma may be needed before "the less fort..."
(47): fragment
    I'm not sure what's being said. Is it more than just: "High prices preclude
    the pragmatic purchase of pharmaceuticals by those with less-than-average
    purchasing power, in [a] blatant violation of the aforesaid Rawlsian perspective." ?
(48): clarify the solution
    "bear the burden" as in pay for those unable to afford, but still in need
    of drugs?
(49): obtuse word. define it.
(50): comma "support, critical"
    Also, "critical progroms" such as?
(51): "services" -> "services'" ?
(52): word choice, vague. 
    c'mon "everyone" ? how about "qualifying Canadian citizens" 

(53): awkward phrasing. omit "an" or rewrite clause
(54): hahahaha
    "fall short of...", or if you insist on a dash of humor, "fall
    far past short of..". I would advise moderation.  
    
    Also, do you mean that ethical arguments in favor of contriving a pricing
    scheme are inadequate or that ethical arguments presenting an
    already-formulated pricing scheme fall short?
(55):   
    Of course, naturally -- obviously even --, nothing is obvious. Everyone
    knows that.
(56): awkward phrasing
    Perhaps, "Reconciling obliged sympathy for patients with the pragmatic,
    logistical constraints of the non-theorectical..." suffices to express the
    tension?
(57): word choice: "smart"?!!! clarify
(58): "as well as" -> "and"
(59): "for cheap" -> "cheaply"
(60): who where. c'mon. in what capacity? insurance, lower prices, both?
(61): this sentence be broke af. 
    Maybe, "Without third-party financing, the pharma industry won't be able to
    provide low prices while still funnelling resources into R&D, even with
    gov't subsidies." ? I'm a bit unclear as to what you wish to convey here,
    so idk if you should just fix the grammar/ambiguity, or rewrite to clarify
    and then check for grammar mistakes.

(62): unclear
(63): "to support its production" -> "to sustain production" ? idk
(64): double use of without. unclear
(65): "civilization" -> "civilizations" ? 
(66): inconsistent use of subjunctive mood
    either make the first clause conditional (or set in the future) or change
    "would be left out to dry" to "are left out to dry"
(67): what kind of Utilitarian stance? expand.
(68): comma abuse. there's no need to put a comma after the subject
(69): "for diseases" -> "for more diseases" ?
    the object is the curability of more diseases, not necessarily a profusion
    of treatments for maladies for which we alread have cures, no?
(70): now use the subjunctive, as in "companies would/could provide"
(71): "deciding to use" -> "using" 
(72): The regulation will be affordable? 
    More like, "regulation could constrain a private insurance system such that premiums
    would be affordable to (most) wage-earners..."
(73):   
    isn't this how premiums are set currently? I'm a little confused. Don't
    most corporate insurance-as-a-benefit deals depend upon just such an
    company-wide risk pool, with actuarial premiums (those paid by the corp to the
    medical liaison or drug retailers) ?
    Perhaps emphasize the non-profit aspect, as that seems the sole noteworthy
    distinction.
(74): "cannot" -> "could not". needs past tense
(75): "prejudice": what kind? 
    perhaps clarify whether you refer to that of class, race, financial means?
    also what about people with pre-existing conditions. there was little
    mention of that, and I hear it's a popular counter to health-care reform
    proposals (specifically those targeting "prejudice").
